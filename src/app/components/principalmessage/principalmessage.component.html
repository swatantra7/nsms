        Welcome to our website! Whether you are a prospective student, faculty colleague or friend, or an alumnus, I appreciate your interest in our Mother TERESA A.N.M Trainning School <br><br>
        Join us and become a "Wildcat" professional nurse leader! Or connect with us to support Wildcat nursing in any capacity. We represent a growth profession in both entry-level and advanced nursing practice. Nursing is a versatile profession that allows one to have multiple varied careers over a lifetime without ever leaving nursing. Nurses practice everywhere - the opportunities are limitless!<br><br>
        Perhaps you are or want to be on the front lines of patient care in hospitals and long-term care facilities; in public health, school or community health centers; in military, government or flight nursing. With an advanced degree, you might be or want to be a teacher of nursing in community colleges or university schools; a primary-care clinician in group practices, clinics and ambulatory care facilities; a nurse executive in virtually every kind of health care-related entity; or a nurse researcher in a university or a health-related corporation.
